                        <span class="fw-bold">Var</span> is hoisted, always declared at the top. Which acts as a
                        global
                        parameter. It has functional
                        scope,
                        so it can be used inside anywhere of a function. In contrast, <span class="fw-bold">Let</span>
                        acts as block scope. So, it
                        can only be used within a block of code (curly braces{}). Let can be used to reassign or
                        updating
                        value but it does not allow
                        redeclaring. Whereas,
                        <span class="fw-bold">Const</span> is neither reassignable nor redeclarable. Variables declared
                        with the const maintain constant values. Const also, does
                        not support functional scope.
                        It is contrained
                        to be block scope. <span class="fw-bold">Var</span> was immensly used before the introduction of
                        <span class="fw-bold">ES6</span>. Right now, <span class="fw-bold">Let</span> and
                        <span class="fw-bold">Const</span> are more popular
                        and adviceable to use as it serves confined purposes.

                    <div class="accordion-body">
                        The first obviouos difference would be in their syntaxes. Regular functions can be used as
                        constructor functions but arrow
                        function can not be used for such feat. Arrow functions also do not have <span
                            class="fw-bold">"this"</span> keyword like the
                        regular functions. Inside a regular JavaScript
                        function the value of <span class="fw-bold">"this"</span> can be dynamic but for Arrow functions
                        it is fixed throughout the
                        entire function.
                        Regular functions allow users to pass duplicate parameters but arrow functions do not have this
                        felxibility.

                    <div class="accordion-body">With the introduction of ES6, JavaScript added a new feature to write
                        multiline code dynamically.
                        This is known as template literals which is done by using back-ticks (``) rather than the
                        conventional use of double ("") or single ('') quotes to define a string.
                        This feature allows the users to insert variables and expressions into strings without needing
                        to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript.
                        Template strings can be nested in each other. This is a great feature because many people want
                        to create dynamic strings.

                    <div class="accordion-body">
                        There's a slight distinguishable difference between the use of <span
                            class="fw-bold">forEach()</span> and <span class="fw-bold">map()</span>.
                        Both of these options perform same type of tasks on an array but their main difference lies in
                        what they
                        return after the operation. Both of <span class="fw-bold">forEach()</span> and <span
                            class="fw-bold">map()</span> is used to execute the same code on
                        every element of
                        the array but <span class="fw-bold">forEach()</span> does not change the array and it return the
                        whole
                        array. Whereas, <span class="fw-bold">map()</span>
                        returns a new array
                        with updated elements.
                        <span class="fw-bold">filter()</span> and <span class="fw-bold">find()</span> are used to
                        search for elements from a collection who satisfies certain
                        criteria. <span class="fw-bold">filter()</span> returns
                        every single element that fulfills a defined logic/argument but <span
                            class="fw-bold">find()</span> only finds and returns
                        the first element that
                        satisfies the query instructions. After finding the first element <span
                            class="fw-bold">find()</span> stops searching and
                        returns only that element.
